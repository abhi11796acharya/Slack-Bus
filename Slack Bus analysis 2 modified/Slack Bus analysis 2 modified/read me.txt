Dear Vanita and Abhishek,

Please see the following observations are need to be performed in detail based on submitted report today.

1. During IEEE 14 bus system case study, instead of [1,2,3 buses] as slack buses, consider  [1,2 buses only] as slack buses and perform the discussed analysis.

2. Similarly during IEEE 30 bus system case study, instead of [1,2,3 buses] as slack buses, consider [1,11,13 buses] as slack buses and perform the discussed analysis.

3. As per report submitted, the total losses computed during different case studies on IEEE 14 and IEEE 30 bus systems didn't match with total generated power 
minus load demand. Look into this issue during above analysis period.i.e.
IEEE 14 bus : Total Losses (as per submitted report)            Total generated power minus load demand (as per computation)
              ONE    24.4632 MW                                                          17.4 MW
         THREE       8.03     MW                                                            4.1 MW

IEEE 30 bus : Total Losses (as per submitted report)            Total generated power minus load demand (as per computation)
              ONE    35.462 MW                                                             25.1 MW
         THREE     26.63   MW                                                            14.3 MW

In general, total losses and total generated power minus load demand must be equal.

4. IEEE 30 bus single line diagram need to be updated at generator bus numbers with respect to PV buses data reported.


And also perform the updated analysis for above case studies, it will be required for your research paper to be published in reputed journal.


Answer
For 30 BUS system
* By mistake i had entered wrong data of bus 22 in real power injection. It has been rectified now.
* Earlier calculated loss is wrong as i had taken one data twice in calculation.
For 14 BUS system
* By mistake i had entered wrong data of bus 6 in real power injection. It has been rectified now.
* Earlier calculated loss is wrong as i had taken one data twice in calculation.
